##USER STORIES

1. As a Cafeteria Manager I want to be able to schedule a food donation pickup quickly and efficiently so I don’t waste my time or resources.

2. As a Restaurant Owner I want to be able to give back to those in need in my community so I can feel like I’m making a difference with my business.

3. As a Volunteer I want to be able to know where to pick up food donations and exactly where the drop spots will be so I can give back and do it within a schedule that I always assumed was unforgiving.
