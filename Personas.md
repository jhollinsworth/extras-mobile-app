###Jason

Jason was raised in a family where giving was an important part of everyday life. His father was on the board of the local Presbyterian church and every year the entire family made it a part of their holiday to volunteer at the annual Thanksgiving banquet for the homeless. One year he’d be in the kitchen, helping cook, the next year he’d serve, handle hosting duties or clean up. Since graduating from college and landing a job in tech where the the pay is lucrative but the hours are demanding, Jason’s begun to miss the feeling of fulfillment he enjoyed by helping out with his father’s church.
