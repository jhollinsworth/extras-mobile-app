##SCENARIOS

###Cynthia

Every day Cynthia finds herself with food of all kinds: fresh, refrigerated, frozen and dried, in boxes, cans and bottles, and it goes uneaten and unused. As someone who prides herself on maintaining an efficient and economical workplace, this detail of her accustomed organizational plan has always pained her. She finds it hard to justify the waste in one area of her business while she maintains prudent, cost-effective control in another. She consults with an executive from the company who routinely takes her lunch later than most. Cynthia is told of an organization that the company has worked with in the past on a food drive, Feed Austin. Their online presence is growing and they’re developing an app to simplify the process of food donation. 

###Phil

Despite all the contributions to the community that Phil is responsible for, he’s still dissatisfied when he sees reports of so many of the city’s residents unable to afford a basic life necessity—food. It doesn’t help that around one out of every four pounds of food goes to the landfill. He finds that unacceptable, especially in a world where the gap between those who are fed and those who aren’t is widening. Phil’s employees take inventory in the kitchen after every shift. He’s just invested $3000 into a brand new commercial blast freezer and the realization quickly dawns on Phil that excess food could be easily flash-frozen and set aside. He goes about researching local food banks and finds an even better resource online, an app that not only expedites the distribution of donated food but puts the control in his hands.

###Jason

Working in tech, many of Jason’s conversations, professional and otherwise, involve computing technology and the web. A discussion with a colleague about online web apps used for shipping and dispatching gradually segues into the ability to use the same technology to move supplies like food and clothing to those who need it and can’t afford it. A quick bit of research after their talk leads Jason to discover the Feed Austin app. Immediately, Jason is replete with a feeling that he hadn’t felt since before college: for the first time in years, he has conceived of a way to give, to help those in need, and do it in a way that is thorough yet accommodating to his busy lifestyle.
